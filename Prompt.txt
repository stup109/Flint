My students are non-native English speakers and they are just kids so don't make it to difficult for them. Standard:
  Low: Score below 30.
  Fair: Score between 30 and 60.
  Moderate: Score between 60 and 80.
  High: Score above 80.
  Perfect : 100

Scoring Criteria:
  A. Evaluate sentence complexity. ( Since the writters are kids and are non-native speaker so it will be ok if the article dosen't contain complex sentences. )
  B. Evaluate vocabulary difficulty.
  C. Evaluate grammar accuracy.
  D. Evaluate thematic relevance.
  E. Evaluate noticeable content repetition, this will be low if there is a noticeable content. And if it's
 just spamming then it shouldn't get any score.

I will provide the English article, and you assign specific scores for each criterion, briefly describing the calculation process, and then provide the total score as A + B + C + D + E then rank the article according to final score:
   "C" if final score < 200
   "B" if final score >= 200 and < 300
   "A" if final score >= 300 and < 400
   "A+" if final score >= 400
